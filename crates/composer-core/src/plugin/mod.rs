//! Plugin system for ported Composer plugins.
//!
//! This module provides native Rust implementations of popular Composer plugins.
//! Since sonata cannot execute PHP-based Composer plugins, these are manually
//! ported and registered as event listeners.
//!
//! Each plugin implements `EventListener` directly and checks if its
//! corresponding package is installed before taking action.
